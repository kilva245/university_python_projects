# University Python Projects 🎓🐍

Welcome to my collection of Python projects developed during my university journey! Each project focuses on practicing core Python skills through simple and practical examples. This repository will be updated as I progress and learn more.

## Projects Included

- **[Net Salary Calculator](#)**  
  A program that calculates the final salary after deductions like tax, insurance, and installments.

- **[Height Checker](#)**  
  A simple program that checks whether a person is tall or average based on their gender and height.

- **[Calculator](#)**  
  A dual-mode calculator that handles arithmetic, comparative, and engineering operations.

- **[Odd and Even Checker](#)**  
  A loop-based program that classifies 10 user-input numbers into even and odd categories.

- *(More projects coming soon...)*

## Topics Covered (So Far)

- Basic input/output handling  
- Mathematical operations  
- Conditional statements (`if/elif/else`)  
- Comparison operators  
- Loops (`for`, `while`) and modular arithmetic

## Future Topics (Coming Soon)

- Functions and modular programming  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File handling
- Working with APIs

## Why This Repository?

This repository showcases my early steps in Python programming. Each project represents my learning milestones and my commitment to continuous improvement. I aim to continue growing as a developer by building on these projects and exploring new concepts.
