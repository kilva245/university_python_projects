# Odd and Even Checker ðŸ”¢

This is a simple Python program that takes 10 numbers as input from the user and classifies each number as either **even (zooj)** or **odd (fard)**.

## How It Works

1. The program asks the user to enter 10 numbers one by one.
2. Each number is checked using the modulo operator (`%`).
3. Based on the result, the number is stored in either the "even" or "odd" list.
4. At the end, the program prints out all even and odd numbers.

## Sample Output

```bash
Enter your number 1: 5
Enter your number 2: 8
...

Zooj numbers: 8 4 10
Fard numbers: 5 3 7
```


## Concepts Used

- `for` loop  
- `if/else` statements  
- Modulo operator `%`  
- String concatenation  
- User input handling
