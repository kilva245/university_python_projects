# Net Salary Calculator

This is a simple Python program to calculate the final salary after deductions.

## How It Works

- The user is asked to input their gross salary (in Toman).
- The program applies the following deductions:
  - **15%** income tax
  - **1,500,000 Toman** for child rights
  - **4,500,000 Toman** for insurance
  - **7,000,000 Toman** for loan installments
- After all deductions, the final (net) salary is displayed.

## Example

```bash
please enter your salary(toman): 30000000
Final asset : 11500000.0 toman
